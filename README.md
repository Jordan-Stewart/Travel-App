This project demonstrates my knoweldge and understanding of all of my learnings from my Nanodegree Front End Web-Developer program through Udacity/RMIT. The primary functionality demonstrates the use of plugins and API integration with a variety of different sources. To interact with this project personally, you will have to register an account with each of the API's being used to attain appropiate login key credentials.

To use the website, run the following commands in order: 'npm install' 'npm run build_prod' and then 'npm run start'. Once this has been completed, navigate to localhost:8081' (or whichever port you'd like to use for running the project, which you can modiy in the server.js file).

There has been a large number of support for this project primarily through mentor support, which I've referenced to as frequently as possible in code comments (there has been about 15 questions in total which mentors have assisted in, and some threads crossed over so the exact knowledge link might not have all the relevent information provided). Additionally, other online resources have been referenced in code comments.

As a general note, a lot of plugins can become incomaptible with updates, so if any errors are being thrown as a result of a speicifc plugin, it is best to run the npm i --legacy-peer-deps command in your console.

Finally, this project has been quite and uphill battle for me in terms of complexity, so it isn't 100% where i'd like it to be prior to submission, but I intend to continue working on this after the conclusion of the course until I'm completely happy with the result. 

Thanks for taking the time to view my project - happy for any comments/suggestions :)
